                    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Zebra as a devloper intern. I attended scrum meetings, 
                        sprint planning, cross team meetings etc. I completed many Immersive Labs relating to 
                        basic Security in files. As well as create a basic REST API with Springboot and MySQL 
                        as the database. During my time there I also completed a MongoDB Basics for Certification,
                        and updated each file to have the updated version.

                    <p>My Capstone Project was sponsored by Costar Group and the request was to create 
                      a Real Time Customer Service Platform. With my group of 4 and 2 mentors from Costar,
                      we were able to complete the Platform, create a presenting powerpoint, and present our
                      project to the school. I worked on the backend, creating the Get, Put, Post, and delete
                      functions as well as working with the Frontend to connect to the functions as well as communicate
                      with our MySQL Database.

                    <p>I have enjoyed pursuing goals in personal projects. Many projects include certification, ie.
                        mongoDB basics certification, or this portfolio website. I am looking to include projects 
                        written in Javascript, a working RESTful API using Java and MongoBD, and interest into Angular
                        as well as React to expand my coding languages.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am a Senior at Virginia Commonwealth University, planning to graduate December of 2022
                    with a Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have interned at Zebra Technology
                    as a Software Developer Intern as well as Truist Financial Bank as a Data Analyst. I am looking
                    for an entry software developer position where I can not only continue learning but also contribute
                    to the company and projects.
                </p>
                <p>I consider myself to be an introvert. However, this doesn't prevent me from working in a team and 
                    communicating to others in my group. As for personal interests I enjoy playing volleyball, as I am on the Men's Club
                    VCU Volleyball team, and exploring the outdoors. Staying in and relaxing with the TV on or playing
                    a game is also how I prefer to spend my time sometimes. I also have a really cute cat, 
                    his name is Neeko.
